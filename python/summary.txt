This excerpt encourages seeking help when facing persistent problems, specifically within the context of using a library's resources. 

It outlines a three-step approach: 

1. **Consult the documentation:**  The first line of action is to refer to the library's existing documentation. This likely includes manuals, FAQs, tutorials, or any material designed to provide guidance and troubleshoot common issues. 

2. **Contact support:** If the documentation doesn't offer a solution, the next step is reaching out to the library's dedicated support team. This could be via email, phone, or a ticketing system.

3. **Engage with the community:** As a final recourse, the excerpt suggests utilizing community forums. These platforms often host fellow library users and experts who can share their knowledge, experiences, and potential workarounds. 

By following these steps, users facing persistent difficulties are encouraged to leverage available resources and seek expert assistance to overcome their challenges.
